### Order products

`order_products__*.csv`

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM order_products__prior_tbl LIMIT 10")
```
 
## orders

`orders.csv`

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. 


```{r}
orders_prev <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM orders_tbl LIMIT 100")
orders_prev
```
 
 An example of aggregation:
```{r}
dbGetQuery(
  sc,
  "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS products
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
  "
  )
```

```{r}
products_popularity_txt <- "
SELECT product_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n_orders
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY n_orders DESC
LIMIT 50
"

products_popularity <-
  dbGetQuery(sc, products_popularity_txt)

products_popularity
```

## Products

`products.csv`

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM products_tbl LIMIT 20")
```

## Questions

* For given department, give the list of the 10 most popular product (with templating department).

```{r}
library(whisker)
library(magrittr)

product_times_ordered_by_department_txt <- "
SELECT op.product_id

LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT product_id
    ,   product_name
    ,   department_id
    FROM products_tbl

data <- list(departmentID = "19")

product_times_ordered_by_department_txt %>%
  whisker.render(data) %>%

```
```{r}
product_times_ordered_by_department_txt %>%

## More on orders (Window Functions)


```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, 
"
SELECT days_since_prior_order
,   COUNT(1) AS N
FROM orders_tbl
GROUP BY days_since_prior_order
") 
```


```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, 
"SELECT * 
FROM orders_tbl
WHERE user_id <= 10
")
```
En la próxima query usamos una window function, con el OVER(PARTITION by ...)

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, 
"SELECT user_id
,   order_id
,   FIRST_VALUE(order_id)  OVER(partition by user_id ORDER BY order_number) AS first_order
FROM orders_tbl
WHERE user_id <= 10 
")
```
SI QUEREMOS HACER LA PARTICIÓN TAMBIÉN POR AÑO:
FIRST_VALUE(order_id)  OVER(partition by user_id, year ORDER BY order_number) AS first_order


* Product that is usually orders in numerous baskets

```{r}
"
SELECT product_id
,   AVG(products_number) AS avg_products_number
FROM (
    SELECT order_id
    ,   product_id
    ,   COUNT(product_id)  OVER(partition by order_id) AS products_number
    FROM order_products__train_tbl
) pn
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY avg_products_number DESC
LIMIT 100
" %>%
dbGetQuery(sc, .)
```

* Could modify the query and add prduct name?

```{r}
"
